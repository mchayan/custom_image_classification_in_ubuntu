<h1>Custom image classification in Ubuntu</h1>
This custom image classification project is developed in ubuntu. Aim of this project is to identify whether the person is wearing glass or not. The final output will classify a person as known person (If the person is wearing a glass) or unknown person (If the person is  not wearing a glass) in any video. Here is the step by step procedure of how to develop it.

# Installation

## Dependencies

Tensorflow Object Detection API depends on the following libraries:

*   Protobuf 3.0.0
*   Python-tk
*   Pillow 1.0
*   lxml
*   tf Slim (which is included in the "tensorflow/models/research/" checkout)
*   Jupyter notebook
*   Matplotlib
*   Tensorflow (>=1.12.0)
*   Cython
*   contextlib2
*   cocoapi


Open the terminal and write these command bellow.

``` bash
# For CPU
pip install tensorflow
# For GPU
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
  
Install dependencies using pip:

``` bash
pip install contextlib2
pip install pillow
pip install lxml
pip install jupyter
pip install matplotlib
```

All the required dependencies are easy to install except protoc. To install protoc type the command bellow.

``` bash
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler python-pil python-lxml python-tk
```

As all the depedecies installation is done, it's time to check the configuration is done or not. To verify please download the office Tensorflow-model from- 

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
```

Go to the research directory of your downloaded git model and type the command 
``` bash
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto â€“python_out=.
```

like this-

Now type this comand to give python path in both research and models directory otherwise you will get error.

``` bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
```

If everything is perfectly done you will be able to detect object using tensorflow's pre trained model. Type the command below

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```
You will see object_detection_tutorial.ipnyb  file in your browser.

Click run-all and you will see output like this

As it's all done it's time to develop custom object detection

First you need to collect your dataset. Then annotate the images using [Image Labeling Software Like- labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).
After creating .xml (Annotated File) now it's time to convert the xml files to csv. Create a folder named object-detection. Create folders named data, images, training under object-detection folder.
Create another two folders named test and train inside images folder. Copy all your .xml and image files inside images folder. Copy 80% of your images + perspectiv .xml to train directory and rest of the 20% images + perspectiv .xml in test directory.  

Now run the python file xml_csv.py. The code is available in object-detection Folder.

Now go to research directory and type the command-

``` bash
python3 setup.py install
```

It's time to generate .record files. 

``` bash
python generate_tfrecord.py --csv_input=data/train_labels.csv --output_path=data/train.record --image_dir=./images 
```
